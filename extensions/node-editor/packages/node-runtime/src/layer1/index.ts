// Layer1 — the headless, domain-agnostic runtime kernel. Pure node.js with no UI, HTTP
// server, or plugin-manifest parsing: it takes a graph plus asset files and produces
// executor results, leaving every plugin-specific concern to the OpSpec.execute closures
// plugins attach at registration time. This barrel is the cluster's public face, gathering
// the kernel's sibling sub-clusters — the type contracts, op registry, executor and its
// dispatcher, path resolver, datatree, loader, storage, asset-resolver, and shared utils —
// into the single surface layer2 builds its runtime orchestration on.
