适用：单个物件 / 机械件 / 装配体（枪、宝箱、齿轮组、机械臂…）——任何非平凡物件都走下面的
**强制两阶段工作流**。建筑走 [PART B](part-b-building.md)；把已 bake 的件摆成场景走
[PART C](part-c-scene-assembly.md)。

## 需求特征 → op（先选再写）

- 规则轮廓、孔腔、倒角 → Profile/CSG；齿、铰链、把手、风扇、面板 → Parts/Gears。
- 装配 datum 可由 bbox 表达时，优先 `align_centers`、`place_on_face`、`place_on_surface`，再写 joint；不要反复手算 origin。
- manifest 每件只保留 `name/shape/dims/features/datum/ops`。同一缺陷最多 3 次 patch；sourceHash/fingerprint 不变即停止。

## Workflow spine — model each part → bake → assemble

`caller.kind = "ai"`. Every non-trivial object is built in two passes and **never
in a single mega-model**:

1. **Set up.** Open/create a project with `lowpoly:projects.*`. Get op signatures
   from [core](../op-directory/core.md) / [parts-mechanical](../op-directory/parts-mechanical.md) /
   [assembly-misc](../op-directory/assembly-misc.md) — do **not** call `batteries.list` /
   `batteries.get`.
2. **Phase 0 — part manifest (hard gate).** One detailed row per part *before* any
   DSL (see below). No manifest, no building.
3. **Phase 1 — model + bake each part (loop).** For each part write a small DSL that
   builds the real detail (CSG / Parts / gears / Architecture) and submit
   `model.apply({ source, bake: "<shape_id>" })`. Record the returned `<sha>.obj`
   filename + bbox. One part per `apply`.
4. **Phase 2 — assemble (one clean DSL).** `mesh(filename=<sha>.obj)` → `part` →
   `material` → `joint` into one rooted tree, then `model.apply({ source })` (the
   compiler auto-appends the QC + URDF terminals — you do not write them).
5. **Iterate on the assembly only** from the receipt signals. To change a part's
   geometry, re-model + re-bake that single part in Phase 1.

## Mandatory Two-Phase Workflow (read before the first `model.apply`)

> **The default failure mode of this skill is laziness: the agent heaps the whole
> object into one big batch, stacks a few `g_box`/`g_cylinder` primitives, the
> batch turns green, and ships a blocky toy that does not look like the object.**
> One mega-batch that builds the entire graph at once *forces* this degradation —
> there is no room to model any single part properly.

**Hard rule — never compose the whole object in a single batch.** Build every
non-trivial object in two phases: model each part *on its own*, bake it to a
reusable mesh, then assemble a clean graph that only *references* those meshes.

This works because the backend already content-addresses baked meshes: when
`g_to_urdf` (or `g_bake_part`) bakes a non-native shape it writes a
content-addressed `.obj` into the workspace-level `library/blobs/` and hands you a
`<sha>.obj` filename. `g_mesh(filename=<sha>.obj)` references it, and the viewer
resolves it over the same baseUrl. So Phase 1 *stages* meshes and Phase 2
*references* them — no re-baking, no re-running heavy CSG at assembly time.

### Phase 0 — Part manifest (hard gate)

Full field spec + worked example are in
[shared-conventions.md § Part manifest](../shared-conventions.md#part-manifest-hard-gate)
(shared with PART D) — **PART A uses all of its fields as-is, no extra columns**.
One row per real part (a distinct solid / distinct material-color / independently
moving piece — no filler rows), each row detailed enough to model *from the row
alone*. A thin list ("A: box, B: cylinder, C: box") is a **failed manifest** and
Phase 1 will degrade straight back into stacked primitives — fix the row before
modeling, not during. **Do not build any node until the manifest is complete.**

### Phase 1 — Per-part standalone modeling + bake staging (loop)

Iterate over the manifest, **one part at a time**. For each part:

1. Write a **small standalone DSL** for just this part. Use `CSG` / `Parts` (incl.
   gears) / `Architecture` to make the real detail — this is where form quality is
   won or lost.
2. Submit `model.apply({ source, bake: "<shape_id>" })` where `<shape_id>` is the
   terminal shape's `id`. The backend bakes it into `library/blobs/` and returns
   `baked.filename = <sha>.obj` (plus `bbox_min` / `bbox_max` / `size`), and
   auto-registers it (query later via `lowpoly:parts.list`).
3. **Record the returned `<sha>.obj` filename + bbox** for Phase 2.
4. Move to the next part — each `bake` apply replaces the graph, so nothing
   accumulates; you carry only the recorded filenames forward.

Phase-1 quality is enforced **only in prose**: pay attention to each part's detail
and formal plausibility as you model it. Phase 1 has **no per-part QC gate** — bake
as soon as the part reads right and move on. Model each part around its **own local
origin / assembly datum**: the bake stores *local* coordinates, so all placement
happens later in Phase 2 via part/joint origins.

The anti-primitive rules still govern Phase-1 modeling — see
[shared-conventions.md § Anti-primitive modeling rules](../shared-conventions.md#anti-primitive-modeling-rules)
(shared with PART D) for the full "which CSG/Parts op builds this for real?"
table. `g_bake_part` skips native primitives on purpose: if `shape_id` points at
a `box`/`cylinder`/`sphere` it bakes nothing and returns an empty `filename` plus
a `note`. Such trivial parts need no mesh — assemble them in Phase 2 with `g_box`
/ `g_cylinder` / `g_sphere` directly.

### Phase 2 — Reference meshes to assemble (rewrite a clean lightweight DSL)

Start a **fresh, clean geometry DSL** — do **not** reuse Phase-1 subgraphs. For
each part:

- **non-trivial part** → `g_mesh(filename = the <sha>.obj staged in Phase 1)`
  (wire `g_bake_part.filename` straight into `g_mesh.filename`, or paste the
  literal). 
- **trivial primitive part** → `g_box` / `g_cylinder` / `g_sphere` directly.
- wrap each shape with `g_part`.
- **color each part with `g_material` / `g_named_color`** — color rides on the
  URDF `<material>` on the link, it does **not** go into the mesh.
- **articulated assembly** → connect parts with `g_joint_*` into a **single rooted
  tree** (routes through the URDF pipeline). **A single static object with no moving
  joints** needs no `g_joint_*` — a jointless DSL routes through the STATIC pipeline
  (`g_to_scene`, exported as a single merged `.glb` via `mode="static"`).
- optionally `g_auto_collision` (URDF path only; a mesh visual gets an AABB collision).
- submit `model.apply({ source })`. The compiler auto-appends the QC terminal plus the
  content-selected terminal (URDF `g_to_urdf` when joints are present, else static
  `g_to_scene`); judge completion from the receipt signals (see
  [quickstart.md](../quickstart.md#iteration-loop)).

If the assembled object is wrong, only adjust **joints / placement / color** in
Phase 2 — do **not** reach back into a part's internals. To change a part's
geometry, re-model and re-bake that single part in Phase 1.

**Material decision (PART A default):** the per-part stage format is **OBJ (pure
geometry)**; `g_bake_part` bakes geometry only and color is applied in Phase 2 by
`g_material` on the link. This keeps geometry deduped and lets you recolor per
instance.

**Phase-2 efficiency check:** because Phase 2 is all native `g_mesh` references,
`g_to_urdf` should report `bakeFallbacks = 0`, `report.meshFileCount = 0`, and
`stats.meshProvenance` all `native` — it does **not** re-bake; the meshes were
already staged in `library/blobs/` during Phase 1.

### Forbidden anti-pattern

A single mega-model that heaps the entire object's shapes, parts and joints into
one DSL. It always degrades into primitive stacking and under-modeled parts.
Phase 1 (per-part bake) and Phase 2 (mesh references → assembly) are mandatory
and separate.

## Modeling Decisions

- Prefer semantic ops (Parts, gears, Architecture, CSG) over stacked primitives;
  route with the table in [battery-catalog.md](../battery-catalog.md). Op
  signatures come from the [core](../op-directory/core.md) /
  [parts-mechanical](../op-directory/parts-mechanical.md) op-directory shards —
  never guess, never call `batteries.list` / `batteries.get`.
- **Two-phase for any non-trivial object**: Phase 1 bakes each part to a
  `<sha>.obj` (one `model.apply({bake})` per part), Phase 2 references them with
  `mesh` and assembles in one `model.apply`. Keep units in meters, Z-up.
- Judge completion from the receipt signals (`errors` / `qc` / `meshQc` / `urdf`).
