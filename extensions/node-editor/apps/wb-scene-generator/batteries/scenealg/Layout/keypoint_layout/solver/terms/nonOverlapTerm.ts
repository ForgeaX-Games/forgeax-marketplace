// Non-overlap term: a one-sided penalty over node pairs that are NOT in an
// ancestor–descendant relationship (siblings, cousins, unrelated). Only active
// when the two circles overlap (overlap = r_a + r_b - d > 0), pushing them apart
// to at most tangency. Nested regions are intentionally excluded — a parent is
// meant to contain its children (see containmentTerm). O(n²); n is small.
