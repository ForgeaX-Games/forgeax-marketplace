# Quickstart

Use Studio ToolRegistry as the only control plane:

1. `asset2d:projects.list` to find the active project.
2. `asset2d:projects.create` or `asset2d:projects.open` when needed.
3. `asset2d:batteries.list` and `asset2d:batteries.get` to inspect exact op IDs,
   params, inputs, and outputs.
4. `asset2d:pipeline.get` to read the current graph.
5. `asset2d:pipeline.applyBatch` to mutate the graph.
6. `asset2d:pipeline.execute` to run the graph.
7. `asset2d:renderer.info` / `asset2d:renderer.setViewMode` and
   `asset2d:screenshot.capture` to inspect the preview.
8. `asset2d:assets.list` to inspect generated project assets.

Do not write runtime JSON directly. The backend persists graphs, history, and
outputs through node-runtime so human UI actions and AI tool calls stay on the
same path.

## Example Tool Call

```json
{
  "toolId": "asset2d:batteries.list",
  "args": {},
  "caller": { "kind": "ai" }
}
```

## Iteration Loop

After every meaningful graph change:

1. Execute the graph.
2. Capture or read the latest preview screenshot.
3. Inspect renderer state, selected layers, and assets when relevant.
4. Apply another focused batch if the screenshot or outputs show a mismatch.
