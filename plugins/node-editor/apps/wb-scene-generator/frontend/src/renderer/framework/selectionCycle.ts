// layers (top-most first). Clicking a NEW cell selects the top-most (index 0);
// re-clicking the SAME cell steps one layer deeper, wrapping back to the top at
// the bottom. Moving to a different cell resets the cycle. Extracted as a pure
// reducer over (previous anchor cell, previous index) so it is deterministic and
// unit-testable, with no dependency on React refs or the DOM.
